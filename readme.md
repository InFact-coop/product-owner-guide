# Product Owner Guide

A rough guide for those who are product owners on a dwyl project.

### Optimal Team Size - Brooks' Law

Sometimes when a deadline is nearing or timing is looking tight then it can
feel tempting to add more people to the team with the aim of getting things done
faster. However it is worth considering Brooks' Law which suggests that
effectiveness/efficiency can decline with too many people. How can this be the
case?

Bringing on new team members has costs as well as benefits:

- Time to learn and get up-to-speed with context/codebase
- Existing (productive) team members time occupied by reviewing new (far less
  productive) team members work at the expense of getting on with their own. i.e.
  output is cut in half not "doubled"!
- Overlap and "stepping on toes" where features are not isolated enough leads to
merge conflicts (where one person's work can "undo" someone else's) which can
take up way more time.

The best time for the whole team to start is at the "ideation" or "Design Sprint"
stage so that no time is wasted on this on-boarding later on.
