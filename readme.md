# Product Owner Guide

A rough guide for those who are product owners on a dwyl project.

## What is a Product Owner?

**A Product Owner (PO)** is someone who represents the views and needs of the
target audience, stakeholders and the business they represent in agile scrum
methodology. They must understand and communicate the vision of the product to
the rest of the team.

They are the liaison between customers and the development team. This means that
they are responsible for working with stakeholders and user groups to determine
their needs. Then through collaboration with the Scrum Master and developer team
they prioritise and discuss these ideas moulding them into features to be built.

**PO Responsibilities:**
1. Owner and creator of the product backlog* :crown:
2. Adding new features to the [backlog](#what-is-the-backlog?). :new:
3. Describing the user-persona(s) in as much detail as possible to make the
"pain" they feel _real_ (_especially useful when the team is remote and don't
often meet with the end-users_) üìù
4. Clearly define, understand and _empathise_ with the end-user. üë© üí°
5. Approving or critiquing development work for release. :white_check_mark:
6. Involving customers or users and getting their feedback to continuously shape
the product development. :+1: :thumbsdown:
7. Maintaining and _updating_ the backlog: adjusting the features and _priority_
as needed after each sprint or iteration. :small_red_triangle: :small_red_triangle_down:
8. Attach a _business_ or _customer_ value to each story/task in the backlog to
ensure that we are building features that are genuinely wanted/needed by users. üí∏
9. Have a clear picture of "competitors" and the "market" for similar
products/service to avoid "re-inventing" something that already exists! (_i.e.
  don't try to replace App/Site ABC, you are wasting your time! instead find
  something they aren't doing or are doing poorly and focus on that!_) üîç
10. Be familiar with _existing_ UX/UI through personal use of other/existing
Apps/services to know what can be done/re-used. ‚ôªÔ∏è
11. Trust the expertise of your technical team on matters of technical
importance (although feel free to ask them to try to learn more about _why_
  certain things matter when you may not be familiar with what they are) :punch:
12. Note, in order to be able to perform these responsibilities it's important
that POs have been given the authority and means necessary to complete them. :muscle:

*product backlog: a prioritised features list for the product found on github.

## What is the backlog?

The backlog is your project's to do list, a list of all the features and things
that need doing. This list contains not only the things that you're planning
imminently but also ideas you want to discuss in the future or feature requests
that are yet to be validated. As not all of the issues in the backlog are ready
to work on we use labels to indicate things like priority or whether something
is blocking an issue from being worked on. With the labels as a visual cue you
can scan the backlog and get a flavour for what's important on the project at
present.

### Where can I find the backlog?

In order to keep track of progress on a project we use github, see
https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference to learn more about using github.  To
see the backlog click on the 'issues' tab at the top of your project:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34989963-4bc6a354-fabc-11e7-915b-d578e5f3dc34.png" width=250px />

This will display a list of all of the individual things to do in your project.
Something which needs doing on github is called an 'issue'.

### Why github when we could use trello / basecamp / <-insert-other-site-here->?
We use github because unlike other platforms it acts as a **single source of
truth** :angel:. What does this mean? It means that github is the one place
where the whole team can see the status of the project at a given time. Why
can't another site be the single source of truth? Github is the site our
developers use to upload their code to, for this reason you can see live updates
of their code when it is added to the site, like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34993671-04698cc6-fac9-11e7-9977-b14918d98c99.png)

If we were to use another platform like trello then we'd have to manually update
the progress on issues which would not only take time :hourglass: but also
create a lag between things being done and everyone being able to see :eyes:
that they've been done. Then we would have 2 records of the status of the
project, the truth as told by trello and then the truth as told by the site
storing our code. We think this is an unnecessary complication so we keep
everything on github! ‚ù§Ô∏è :octocat: Still want to know more about why we use github? Go to https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why

## Template for making an issue

**The 3 components you should include when creating an issue are:**

1. A User story
2. Acceptance Criteria
3. A screenshot of a mock-up or a bug on the site (where possible)

Followed by... any other useful/ relevant information for completing the issue.

### User Stories

A user story is a phrase which describes the what, why and who is it for of each
issue. To write one complete the following three starters:

**As...** a team member - **WHO**
**I want to...** see a user story on every issue I read  - **WHAT**
**so that...** I know the context in which the issue is set to help me understand
it better - **WHY**

**Here's another example:**

**As** someone in need of a bin
**I want to** be able to filter on the online shopping site by 'lid type'
**So that** I can find a bin that closes securely to stop mice getting into my
bin üê≠ ‚ùå üóë üßÄ

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are checkboxes that a developer knows they need to complete
before that issue can be considered 'done'. They are the points against which
the issue will be tested.

### A screenshot or mock up of a new design
A picture which illustrates what the issue should be creating or a screenshot of
an existing page showing where a bug is occurring. Remember to include mock ups
of both mobile and desktop views.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34988677-617ac428-fab7-11e7-9f07-3c47a84d2ab5.png" width=150px />

## Responsiveness standards for testing

When you begin a project it is likely you will discuss target audience and
device compatibility. These conversations will cover the important behaviours
of your customers including browser type, device type and any other specific
compatibility requirements e.g. accessibility.

Generally speaking most projects will focus on being mobile, tablet and desktop
friendly and for these measures we use the inbuilt device sizes provided by
browsers to test the application. These devices sizes cover a range of
dimensions and a variety of the most popular iOS and android devices. Testing
using these devices is not only capturing a large part of the user market but
it is also a shared metric and easy way to spot and communicate bugs across a team.

E.g. 'The subheading on the landing page is currently obscured on iPhone 6'
gives the development team a quickly understandable and recognisable way of
finding and fixing a given problem.

### How to test using standard device sizes
To open 'Inspect' right click on your computer with your browser open or if you
are a mac user press control and then click. This menu should appear, then click
on 'Inspect':
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34882711-54e6a642-f7af-11e7-9044-509708116fea.png" width=150px />

Now your browser has 'Inspect' or 'Dev tools' open you should make sure you are
using the device mode. Look for this symbol in the menu:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34883357-56336aec-f7b1-11e7-8ed3-6cbf3a0483e5.png)

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34882755-7633219a-f7af-11e7-92ef-5064cbecf73f.png" width=250px />

If the symbol is orange then you're already in device mode. If it is not, then
click on it so it turns orange. Next, look for this bar and click on the
left-hand dropdown menu to select a device:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34882773-827408e8-f7af-11e7-80a7-626d27409c9e.png" width=450px />

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34882785-890093ac-f7af-11e7-9c65-33bd9399ebca.png" width=130px />

This list is an automatically updated list contained within your browser. It
contains the most popular standard devices sizes for you to test your site against.

Your page will now display according to the dimensions of the device you have
selected:
E.g. iPhone 7:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16775804/34883575-d85ae5ea-f7b1-11e7-8b26-03e6df9c8a12.png)

iPad:

So if you come across a bug :bug: remember to include lots of detail to help
your team replicate it. Think:

- What pathway did I take to get to the error? ie. who was I logged in as?
:busts_in_silhouette: what was I trying to do when it happened?
- What device or browser was I using? :iphone::computer: e.g. Internet Explorer
v10 or iPhone 6 view.

Then take a screenshot of the bug and put it all into an issue to be fixed
:wrench: :sparkles:.

## What is Technical Debt?

[Technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) is the cost to
"re-work" a feature (or entire app) because it was rushed the first time it was built.

Think of Technical Debt like a "loan shark" for your project, if you take
"shortcuts" to implement a feature quickly (e.g: by skipping tests) you will
pay for it later and usually with "interest".

It may feel abstract and hard to understand but it is crucially not ignored.

In other words, whilst in agile methodology we often talk about iterative growth
and only building what is necessary, this should not mean that corners are cut
in the short term that will inevitably end up with greater costs of time and
resources later down the line.

If technical debt does accrue it is worth reducing it systematically. If left
ignored, as other development continues, the debt will grow as the new work
added will also need reworking when the debt is finally addressed. Just like
how financial debt grows when untouched because of interest.

Note: this is related but distinct from retrospective changes that can be made
to a project to make it more performant/relevant/consistent but that could not
have been known/foreseen at the time the code was written.

## Optimal Team Size - Brooks' Law

Sometimes when a deadline is nearing or timing is looking tight then it can
feel tempting to add more people to the team with the aim of getting things done
faster. However it is worth considering Brooks' Law which suggests that
effectiveness/efficiency can decline with too many people. How can this be the
case?

Bringing on new team members has costs as well as benefits:

- Time to learn and get up-to-speed with context/codebase
- Existing (productive) team members time occupied by reviewing new (far less
  productive) team members work at the expense of getting on with their own. i.e.
  output is cut in half not "doubled"!
- Overlap and "stepping on toes" where features are not isolated enough leads to
merge conflicts (where one person's work can "undo" someone else's) which can
take up way more time.

The best time for the whole team to start is at the "ideation" or "Design Sprint"
stage so that no time is wasted on this on-boarding later on.
