# Product Owner Guide

A rough guide for those who are product owners on a dwyl project.

### What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt is a term to describe the implied cost of rework caused by
choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take
longer in the first instance. It may feel abstract and hard to understand but it
is crucially not ignored.

In other words, whilst in agile methodology we often talk about iterative growth
and only building what is necessary, this should not mean that corners are cut
in the short term that will inevitably end up with greater costs of time and
resources later down the line.

If technical debt does accrue it is worth reducing it systematically. If left
ignored, as other development continues, the debt will grow as the new work
added will also need reworking when the debt is finally addressed. Just like
how financial debt grows when untouched because of interest.

Note: this is related but distinct from retrospective changes that can be made
to a project to make it more performant/relevant/consistent but that could not
have been known/foreseen at the time the code was written.
